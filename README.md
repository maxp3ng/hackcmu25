Hack@CMU 2025 Winner - Honorable Mention

Today, bad driving is seen as a necessary sacrifice to the abundance of cars on the road—but it doesn't have to be this way. CoDriver is a driving assistant that makes safe driving both accessible and enjoyable. Utilizing only an Iphone and custom heads up display, CoDriver analyzes your driving style and incentivizes better driving practices—putting you back in control of your car.

Our project attempts to provide an engaging way to track and improve on driving. In front of all of the complex networking is the fun and accessible heads up display, which provides users with an easy to understand and quantifiable way to practice a skill that tends to be neglected as a “subconscious” activity. 

By utilizing the smartphone’s IMU sensor, we are able to track non-economical and generally unsafe driving practices (such as harsh breaking/acceleration). This information is fed back into an algorithm to categorize how unsafe the user’s current driving pracices are. Additionally, this system interacts with the user through a series of different colored LED and an overall driving score that is displayed on the dashboard of a car. FInally, each “run” is saved onto a leaderboard of the users with the highest scores of safe/economical driving.
